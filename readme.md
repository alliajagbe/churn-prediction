# Churn Prediction - Data Science Project
## Summary
- Supervised Machine Learning to Predict Customer Churn Rate

## Solution
- I utilized a Logistic Regression Model for the training model. With an accuracy of 75%, my model outperformed 81% of my peers who also participated in the competition.

## Approach
- I employed different data cleaning techniques to ensure that the data was fit to be fed into the training models. I also explored correlations between the columns to understand the relationships within the data. I then explored different supervised learning models, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning to figure out the one which works best for the model.
